# Getting Started with Jammming App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and it is used to search for the songs / artists / or albums to Spotify through here and get the related songs to your dashboard and you can make your own playlists and even save them.

## To start using the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

*Runs the app in the development mode.\
by default the project runs on port :3000, Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser, you can set your port if the port is being used or you don't want to interrupt it by adding: "set PORT=3001" in Scripts Start in your package.json file.

*If you want to use for your own purpose, you woud have to set your own Spotify client keys : located in util/spotify. 

### "start": "set PORT=3001 && react-scripts start"

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

we have deployed it with [netlify](http://netlify.com/), you can access it through here:
